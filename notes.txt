use the 'npm run build' to create the build folder
The build folder is created after the development is completed.

What build does is
Build compiles all the compenents together into a ingle file,
Then converts the jsx to babel and then creates a single HTML file that links all of the JavaScript, and CSS to it
And gives us an executable HTML  file (Not exactly an executable)

Use state is a special function where it takes the initial value of the variable as a parameter
The speciality about use state is that whenever that state variable changes,react knows the state variable has changed
The use state is used for:
1. The state variable itself
2. The setup function

For an change to affect in the DOM we need to ensure that the variable is a state variable 
To create a state variable we use the 'Use State' variable, which returns the variable itself and the setter function
Since we can't mutate the variable so we use the setup function to set the variable to a new value.
