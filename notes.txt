A token is an alpha-numeric text

To decode a token we use https://jwt.io/

base64 is way to encode or decode text

So the jwt converts to base64. Every JWT has
    1. Header - Type:jwt, alg:SHA256 || HSA
    2. Signature - No other token can be created the same cause every token has a unique signature
                    Can be inside a cookie, etc. To ensure the data is secure
