To install all the dependencies in the package file when downloading a project just use the code 'npm i'
To uninstal dependencies 'npm unin'

Install dev dependencies 'npm i -d 'dependency name'. Usually during production dev dependencies are ignored/not installed

Peer dependencies are needed for a project to work

Difference between library and framework - libraries target a specific functionality, while a framework tries to provide everything required to develop a complete application.
