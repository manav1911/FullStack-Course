Lifecycle of a react component:
    1. Mounting - Is like render, but the first render is called mount. N/B: When a componenet is mounted 
                  state reinitialized. State is only initialized when the component mounts.
    2. Updating - Re-rendering 
    3. Unmounting - Removing the component
    4. Error

Rendering is the process in which a component is added to the DOM

useEffect is a function that is used to capture side effects, a side effect are the lifecycle events

Ideally, when a componenet unmounts we should remove the EventListener, as it eats up memory. it does consume CPU
